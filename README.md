<!--What helps eczema starts here-->
<h2 class="A" id="A">What helps cure <em>eczema</em></h2>

<h4 class="Eczema"><em>Eczema</em> has  always been a tricky one for me... I have had it for as long as I can remember... But over the years I have found many cure that ACTUALLY help!!! And its a big deal to find somthing that actually works believe it or not it is super hard to find cures... It has taken me almost 16 years to find somthing that took it away almost completly<em>(Which we will talk more about later.) So I'm going to list things and talk about what has truely helped me and i hope it helps you!!!</em></h4>
<ul>
    <li class="cures">Lotion</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="Eczema">Now you may be thinking "I already knew that!" But lotoin is a BIG deal!!! And it for me I'm not able to use just any lotoin! I have to have all natrual lotoins or it makes it wores. And for some reason if I use the same lotoin for a long peirod of time it stops  working for me... So i have to switch it up every 6 months or so... How ever that may be different for you. The only wat to know what works for you is to try different things! </h4>
<a class="links" href="https://www.melaleuca.com/ProductStore/Product?sku=6600">Here ae some links for two  of my favorite lotoins!</a>

<a class="links" href="https://www.farmasius.com/farmasi/product/dr-c-tuna-calendula-sleeping-mask-50-ml-usa/11943">here is the second link!</a>

<h4 class="Eczema">Those are my two favorite ones! But I have tried many others... And to find which one helps you best you  have to look around try them out! Not all the same lotoin helps the same people... How ever One type of lotion I don't recommend you use it lotoin that feels sticky or sappy.. It doesnt help it just tend to make it worse! Now if your intrested in making you own i do have a recipe for that! Just click the link below!!!</h4>

<a class="links" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/coconut-lotoin/5983950584365056">Homeade lotoin</a>

<ul>
    <li class="cures">Soaps</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="Eczema">Now soaps have been another very BIG problem for me I can just use what ever soap bars... Down below are two links for ones I have used and like alot! There is only one more i think that I used and like but we bought that local so i dont have a link for it unfortanatly...</h4>
    <a class="links" href="https://www.amazon.com/SheaMoisture-African-Eczema-Therapy-Medicated/dp/B07Q74C28V/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=eczema+charcoal+oat+soap&qid=1620425233&sr=8-10">Charcoal soap</a>
    <a class="links"  href="https://www.melaleuca.com/ProductStore/Product?sku=117">Golden soap</a>
    
    <ul>
        <li class="cures">Baths</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="Eczema">Now there is only one more thing that I can think of besides vitamins and such... And that would be vinagar baths... When i was younger my mom had me take vinigar baths about 2-3 times a day.. Now it did help for awhile over all it gave me releif for a while but I must say the biggest thing that helped me was changing my diet. Which we will talk more about later </h4>
    
    
    <!--What helps suriuses starts here!-->
    <h2 class="G" id="G">What helps suriuses</h2>
    
    <h4 class="head">Now onother thing I have had wrong is suriuses! NOT FUN!!!! How ever i have been able to pretty much get rid of mine! <br>Now Ive been saying I have pretty much gotten rid of this stuff but just a far warning! It never really goes away... But it does get better... like my eczama is no longer raw and itching all the time! And my head is no longer raw ethier but it is SO much better! And I feel happy and Feel like I have energy to do other things besides scratching my self all day(DONT DO THAT IT MAKES IT WORES) But I put the work to fix it and it is so much better!!! </h4> 
    
     <ul>
        <li class="cures">Shampoos and conditioner</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h4 class="head">I at one time had siveir suriuses! Its was so bad it you touched my scalp it was wet and my head was very sinsitive... It first started out as dandruff but over time it esculated... Normal dandruff shampoo didnt help me anymore and I had to stop using just any shampoo because it would make it worse! so i started using several differet kinds of shampoos but this one was my favorite!</h4>

    <h4 class="head">And they have so many kinds its awsome!!! My grandmother also has problems with suriuses and gave me a bottle of the shampoo she uses for it and it really helped! </h4>

    <h4 class="head">And other than that I used castor oil every night before i went to bed I would put it on my scalp. True it did make my hair oily but it did help some. It gave my a sence of releif! And If you have suriuses you know how it can be hard to find that!!!   </h4>
